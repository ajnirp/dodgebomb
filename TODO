implement out of bounds check - done
implement jumping - done
implement friction - done? need to check. not sure about this one.
spotlight follows ball - done
implement enemies - done, needs to be refined with a leveling system
	enemies spawn randomly offscreen with an initial velocity
	they have a bias towards the ball
	enemy types
		normal - move in a straight
		magnetic - attracted towards the ball
ground needs to look better - done, i guess
fix ground tilt on camera movement - hacky, but done
ball should explode when out of bounds - deferred

implement collisions and death
implement a leveling system

misc ideas
as the level increases
	the homing ability of the enemies increases
	their size increases
	the playing field shrinks (while remaining a circle)
	the player's size increases?
	the spotlight dims
