implement out of bounds check - done
implement jumping - done
implement friction - done? need to check. not sure about this one.
spotlight follows ball - done
implement enemies - done, needs to be refined with a leveling system
	enemies spawn randomly offscreen with an initial velocity
	they have a bias towards the ball
	enemy types
		normal - move in a straight
		magnetic - attracted towards the ball
ground needs to look better - done, i guess
fix ground tilt on camera movement - hacky, but done
ball should explode when out of bounds - deferred
implement bouncing - done
implement collisions and death
implement a leveling system
implement a scoring system
implement a 'you have been alive for x seconds' clock
	should pause when displaying 'you died message'

MAKE IT FASTER!!!
	HUGE BUG - when running on personal laptop, the game invariably freezes every 3-4 seconds and the framerate drops to ~15, sometimes as low as 2 :( ... only on firefox though, so maybe not a big deal? end target is sbrowser anyway - wontfix

	remove persistent balls
	remove texture repushing - done
		cache geometries for a given radius
		for that matter, since right now the radius is fixed, we might as well scrap the radius argument to setupBall()
	FIX TEARING!!!!! - done
	display frame rate - done

bring back shadows
	removed shadows, fps shot up from 15-25 to 55-60
	now we need to bring them back

add indicators

misc ideas
as the level increases
	the homing ability of the enemies increases
	their size increases
	the playing field shrinks (while remaining a circle)
	the player's size increases?
	the spotlight dims

separate physics.js file for ballPhysics() and enemyPhysics() ?
